Create a voxel/cube-based version of: {description}

Requirements:
- Use ONLY cube() primitives
- Position cubes with translate()
- Build the object layer by layer
- Make it recognizable despite the blocky style
- Use a consistent cube size (suggest 10x10x10 units)

Think like you're building with LEGO blocks or in Minecraft.

Return complete OpenSCAD code using only cubes.
