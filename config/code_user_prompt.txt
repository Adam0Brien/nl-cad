Convert this design specification into clean, working OpenSCAD code:

{design_specification}

CRITICAL: You must define ALL variables with actual numeric values at the top. Do not write comments instead of variable definitions.

Requirements:
- Start with actual variable definitions (name = number;)
- Every dimension mentioned must have a corresponding variable
- Use proper OpenSCAD syntax throughout
- Include clear comments explaining each section
- Ensure the code will run without "undefined variable" errors
- Use descriptive variable names

Example of WRONG approach:
```
// Dimensions  ← This is just a comment!
// Base        ← This is just a comment!
// Width       ← This is just a comment!
cube([base_width, base_height, base_depth]); ← ERROR: undefined variables
```

Example of CORRECT approach:
```
// Table dimensions
base_width = 120;
base_height = 75;
base_depth = 60;
leg_thickness = 5;

// Main construction
cube([base_width, base_height, base_depth]);
```

Generate ONLY the complete OpenSCAD code with proper variable definitions.
